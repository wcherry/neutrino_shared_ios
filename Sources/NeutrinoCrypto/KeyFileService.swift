// MARK: - KeyFileService
//
// The account's **retired** identity keys, fetched from the server and stored in `KeyArchive`.
//
// A device enrols by importing one keypair — scanned from the web app's key code or read out of an
// exported key file — and that keypair is the account's *active* one. So a device joining an
// account that has rotated could read everything written since the last rotation and nothing
// written before it. The files were still listed, still downloaded, and still would not open. This
// closes that gap, and it is why the pull belongs at enrolment rather than somewhere a user has to
// find.
//
// ── What the server holds, and why it can hold it ────────────────────────────
// Each retired secret key is sealed with `crypto_box_seal` to the keyring's **active** public key
// before upload. The holder of the current identity can therefore recover every identity that came
// before it, and nobody else can — the server included, which has no secret half of anything. What
// is transmitted is ciphertext under a key the server does not have, so this does not bend the rule
// that no usable key material reaches it.
//
// The active key is deliberately *not* in the file, which is why losing every device and the
// recovery kit is still terminal. See `agent_docs/client-only-key-architecture.md` in the backend
// repository.
//
// The web side is `web/packages/e2e-crypto/src/keyFile.ts` (`buildKeyFile` / `openKeyFile`); the
// endpoint is `src/drive/key_files/api.rs`.

// MARK: - Wire types

// rewrite `keyVersion` and the parse would fail.
